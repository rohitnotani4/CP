1. Iterative - Inorder, PreOrder and Postorder
  - Use stack to mimic recursion 
  - Inorder 
      --> Push root to stack, change root to root->left, if root is null, pop the top element and print, change root to top->right
  - Preorder 
      --> Pop from stack and print. If top->right is not null, add it to stack, If top->left is not null, add it to stack
  - Postorder
      --> Use two stacks or below method
      --> The same logic for PreOrder with a little modification i.e. Add Left Child Before Right Child will give the order which is reverse of expected postorder.  Reverse this to get the expected solution. 
  
2.  Zig Zag Level Order Traversal Bt 
  - Use the same logic for as for Level order traversal. Just swap the output for alternating rows.

1.  Merge K Sorted Lists
  - Use priority queue to store K elements, one from each list
  - By default priority stores largest element first, pass the custom compare function to store in ascending order 

2.  Distinct Numbers In Window
  - Use dictonary to store count of each number for each window of size K
  - Increase count of currentIndex element in dictonary and decrease count of (currentIndex - K)th element in dictonary. If count reaches  to zero delete the element from dictonary.
  - Current size of dictonary is number of distinct numbers for that window.

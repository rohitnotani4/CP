  1. Stairs 
  - Straight forward - Fibonacci
  
  2. Longest Increasing Subsequence 
  - O(n^2) solution. For each element check for all previos elments. LIS[i] = LIS[j] + 1 iff A[j] < A[i]. Find max from LIS array.
  - Can be solved in O(n logn) time. Refer : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-monotonically-increasing-subsequence-size-n-log-n/

1. Min XOR pair in an array of 'N' elements 
  - Sort the array and take XOR of adjacent elements
  
2. Max XOR pair in an array of 'N' elements 
  - If the value of elements fall in the range of long/int, this can be done in O(n) time
  - Check from the MSB and find the pair in which one element has that bit set and other element bit unset

3. XOR can be used to find a number which repeats only once, if all other elements repeat twice.

5. If we do (x & (x - 1)), it would just unset the last set bit in x.

1.  Subset and Subset II 
    - Handle duplicates
    - Rest is same as Subset problem. Apply Choose -- Explore remaining decisions -- Un-Choose
    
2.  Permutations and Combinations
    - Chose - UnChose. Use vector for chosen elements.
    
3.  Combination Sum and Combination Sum II
    - Same

4.  Letter Phone
    - Can be reduced to previous questions like (Subset, Permutations etc)
    - We have to chose n (number of integers) characters and for each integer we may 1/2/4 choices 
    - Store int to string map and iterate for each index based on the string obtained by the int at the index
    
5.  Generate all Parentheses II
    - Same
    - A valid parenthesis combination is one in which at any point closed brackets should not be more than open brackets.

6.  Gray Code
    - Let G(n) represent a gray code of n bits. Note that reverse of G(n) is also a valid sequence. Let R(n) denote the reverse of G(n).
    - We can construct 
        G(n+1) as the following : 
        0G(n) 
        1R(n)
      Where 0G(n) means all elements of G(n) prefixed with 0 bit and 1R(n) means all elements of R(n) prefixed with 1.
